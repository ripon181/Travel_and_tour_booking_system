      <p>Exelent poin I have visited.my friends was with me in this tour frist of all we were visited luvachora there one of my friends resident he was invited us in his house so we were made this Plan, There no any communication system available otherwise Boat so we have reached there via boat it was first in my life journey by boat Lala khal, luvachora,srimongol, jaflong,hakhaluki haor,lwachora.was bestSohnkhali is a beautiful beach whose speciality is an abundance of fisherman boats or sampans that graces its coast. Being a great area for the fisherman to take rest and anchor their boats after a fishing trip, the view of colourful sampans against the backdrop of the beautiful ocean presents a surreal feeling. Because of its remote location, it's best to set off early and explore this beach during the day.The beach is situated alongside the Marine Drive road, 54 km from Kolatoli. Picture a quiet and beautiful beach with lines of trees adjoining the sand separating you from the serene looking sea and its blue water, giving you the dreamlike feeling that's hard to come by in most popular sea beaches.</p>
