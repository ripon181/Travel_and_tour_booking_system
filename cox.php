      <p>Sitting and sipping your favourite drink and waiting for the sunset to witness the radiant hue of the sea â€” experiences on the beaches of Cox's Bazar are enticing as ever. When it comes to beaches, chances are you will think about the most popular tourist spots like Laboni Point, Inani or Himchori.Located around 6 km from the Inani sea beach, this quiet beach offers a feeling of tranquillity when you start roaming by the sea. Compared to the other beaches, it's quite clean and the water is bluer like Saint Martins. There are parts of the beach where you will see red crabs along with pebbles and rocks of various sizes. There are quad bike and horse rides available at the beach for hire should you feel like wandering around the whole beach.Located 36 km from Kolatoli, Sohnkhali is a beautiful beach whose speciality is an abundance of fisherman boats or sampans that graces its coast. Being a great area for the fisherman to take rest and anchor their boats after a fishing trip, the view of colourful sampans against the backdrop of the beautiful ocean presents a surreal feeling. Because of its remote location, it's best to set off early and explore this beach during the day.The beach is situated alongside the Marine Drive road, 54 km from Kolatoli. Picture a quiet and beautiful beach with lines of trees adjoining the sand separating you from the serene looking sea and its blue water, giving you the dreamlike feeling that's hard to come by in most popular sea beaches.</p>
