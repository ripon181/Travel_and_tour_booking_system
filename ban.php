      <p>South Asian country Bangladesh is blessed with natural beauty and can also be a great destination for traveling. There are some hilly areas here under the Chittagong Hill Tracts and Bandarban is one of them, others are Rangamati and Khagrachari. Last year, during Rainy Season it was a great pleasure to travel to some truly attractive destinations with my friend. We did visit Kaptai, Rangamati, and Bandarban and frankly speaking without visiting those places it will be totally unknown to me that my own country is such beauty in a true sense. So how was my Bandarban tour? Explore details inside. 

What I’ve loved most in Bandarban? 
I was in love with nature here. I’ve loved to play with green, blue and white  Awe, thinking!! What are those? Yes, they are my favorite green leaves, bushes, blue sky and white clouds. I really lost myself here with natural waterfalls, river, and mountains. I’ll recommend all tourists and mainly nature lovers to visit this naturally beautiful destination in Asia. The largest Buddhist Golden Temple, Buddha Dhatu Jadi is also located in the Bandarban district of Bangladesh.

During our Bandarban tour we stayed at Holiday Inn Resort, this resort caught my eyes because of its totally different decors with nature. Some beautiful spots are too near to this resort. There are many popular tourist spots here and some must-visit naturally beautiful spots for all nature lovers are Nilachal, Nilgiri, Shoilo Propat, Sangu River, Rijuk Waterfall, Boka Lake, Nafakhum and Remakri, Keokradong and Meghla Tourist Spot.

Nilachal

One of the most charming place and also known as Tiger Hill. This is very near to the Holiday Inn Resort I’ve stayed at Meghla. Rainy Season is the best time to visit this amazing place which is about 2000 feet above the sea level. Undoubtedly, you can spend more hours here enjoying the amazing landscape, the softness of white clouds and of course the beauty of a sunset. And I was overwhelmed enjoying all. The Nilachal Hill Resort is also located here, so will you not love to stay with clouds here?
