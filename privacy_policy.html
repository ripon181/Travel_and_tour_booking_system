<p><span style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Input Design converts the user-oriented inputs to computer-based formats. Inaccurate
input data are the most common cause of errors in data processing. Error data entered by the data
operator can be controlled by the input design. The goal of designing input is to make the data
entry easy, logical and as free from errors as much as possible.
The proposed system is completely menu-driven. It is a powerful tool for interactive
design. It helps the user comprehend the range of alternatives available and also prevents them
from making an invalid selection. All entry screens are interactive in nature. It has been designed
taking into account all the constraints of the end-user.
Some other features included are:
 The form title clearly states the purpose of the form
 Adequate space is given for data entry
Data Validation is done for eliminating duplicate entries
Outputs are the most important and direct source of information to the customer and
management. Intelligent output design will improve the system's relationship with the user and
help in decision making. Outputs are used to make permanent hard copy of the results for later
consultation. The output generated by the system is often regarded as the criteria for evaluating
the performance of the system. The output design was based on the following factors.
 Usefulness determining the various outputs to be printed to the system user.
 Differentiating between the outputs to be displayed and those to be printed.
 The format for the presentation of the output.
For the proposed system, it is necessary that the output should be compatible with the existing
manual reports. The outputs have been formatted with this consideration in mind. The outputs
are obtained after all the phase, from the system can be displayed or can be produced in the hard</span><br></p>
