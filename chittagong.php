      <p>Stroll along the flat bay of Patenga Beach, scattered with large chunks of concrete to deter erosion and lined sporadically with small huts or trees. Many street vendors sell ice creams and drinks but don't miss the chance to taste the area's speciality-- fried spicy mud crab served with falafel and vegetables. The beach is mostly enjoyed by locals who come to sit on the concrete slabs and pass the time looking out to the sea, as swimming is not recommended here. Visit in the evening for a vibrant atmosphere, and the chance to see beautiful sunsets and sunrises spreading across the horizon-- known as the best in Bangladesh. Put Patenga Beach and other Chittagong City attractions into our Chittagong City trip itinerary site, and watch your holiday take shape.
 it's best to set off early and explore this beach during the day.The beach is situated alongside the Marine Drive road, 54 km from Kolatoli. Picture a quiet and beautiful beach with lines of trees adjoining the sand separating you from the serene looking sea and its blue water, giving you the dreamlike feeling that's hard to come by in most popular sea beaches.</p>
